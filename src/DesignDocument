LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
private int x - This variable represents the x-coordinate of the first coordinate
	private int y - This variable represents the y-coordinate of the first coordinate
	private int xOne - This variable represents the x-coordinate of the second coordinate
	private int yOne - This variable represents the y-coordinate of the second coordinate

Constructor
	public LinearEquation(4 integer values to be assigned, which refers to the 2 x and 2 y coordinates the user should enter)


Methods
public double slopeLine - returns slope of the line

public double yInt - returns y-intercept (rounded)

public String slopeInt - returns the slope intercept form (rounded)

public double distancePoint - returns the distance between points (rounded)

public double getYFromX - get y after inputting user's x (rounded)

public String toString() - returns all the method results
    String s0 x + y
    String s1 xOne + yOne
    String s2 slopeLine()
    String s3 yInt()
    String s4 slopeInt()
    String s5 distancePoint()
    return s0 + s1 + s2 + s3 +s4 +s5 -this should print(return) all of the method results
    }


EquationRunner.java
Step 1: add a scanner class
Step 2: Ask user to enter first coordinate pair
Step 3: Splits input into x value and y value through substring and arrays
Step 4: Ask user to enter second coordinate pair
Step 5: Splits input into x value and y value for the second coordinate through substring and arrays
Step 6: Prints out the following:
The two coordinates
The slope of line
The y-intercept of the line
the slope-intercept form
The distance between the two points
Step 7: asks the user to enter a x-value
Step 8: print out the solved coordinate point
